We will also cover useful information regarding Wireless Networks and how to set them up properly.

## Chapter 2: Firewalls and Routing

In this chapter we will cover the notion of routing. It includes comcepts such as Network Address Translation, Gateways, Firewalls, and other
means of establishing communications between computer systems.

## Chater 3: DNS, HTTP and HTTPS

Here we will learn how DNS works and why it is important when deploying web applications. We will also explore the specifics of the HTTP 
protocol and how asymmetric cryptography makes HTTPS possible and why it is important.

## Chapter 4: Hyper-V

We start getting more sophisticated in this chapter. We take a look at Virtual Machines, Virtual Hard Disks, Virtual Switches, and Virtual
Network Adapters.

## Chapter 5: Windows Azure

We will cover the fundamentals of cloud computing starting by understanding the difference between IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. We will also learn
how to successfully deploy various types of applications.

## Chapter 6: Network Security

We will understand the usefulness of a Web Application Firewall and how to perform penetration testing on web applications with well-known tools.
We will also explore common attacks such as DDoS, SQLi, XSS, Dictionary Password Guessing and Bruteforce Password Gessing, and how to stop
them. We will learn how to setup firewall rules and ploicies.

## Chapter 7: Continuous Integration

Although this topic leans more towards developers, it is important that a network engineer understands and is also capable of setting up
simple CI and CD environments.

## Chapter 8: Identity Management

In this chapter we will cover basic aspects of Active Directory management, LDAP connections, Azure Directory integration, etc.

## Chapter 9: Office 365

## Chapter 10: The Provate Branch Exchange

We will cover the basics of getting aphone system correctly configured, the implications of using different audo codecs, Trunks, FXO
Gateways, VoIP phones and their types, and QoS.

## Chapter 11: Other Systems

I have left this chapter to cover applications that are typically required in an enterprise environment. These include FTP servers,
