# Nanoweb Qt Web Engine minimal browser

This is the source for the minimal browser and virtual keyboard support.
```bash
nanoweb https://www.unosquare.com
```

TODO:
- ~~Use QtWebEngine 1.2 to support FullScreen! See [the documentation here](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtwebengine-webenginesettings.html#fullscreenSupportEnabled-prop)~~
- ~~Enable a key combo to exit the browser app. See [this StackOverflow Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11845734/how-to-create-a-correct-exit-button-in-qt)~~ Alt+F4 now exits as expected
